# Filling in the Gaps
#
# Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix, such as spam001.txt, spam002.txt,
# and so on, in a single folder and locates any gaps in the numbering (such as if there is a spam001.txt
# and spam003.txt but no spam002.txt). Have the program rename all the later files to close this gap.
#
# As an added challenge, write another program that can insert gaps into numbered files so that a new file can be added.
# spam001.txt  // spam56.txt // 10spam.txt // spam00123spam.txt
